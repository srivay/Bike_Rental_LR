# Bike Rental Case Study using Linear Regression

## Background:

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Company Info:
Boom Bike wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
They want to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around.
By doing this, they want to stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## High Level Requirements
Boom Bikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
The company wants to know the following -
#### Significant Variables in Predicting demand of shared bikes
#### How well these significant variables describe the demands of the bike

## Business Goal (Objectives)
Create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To know the accuracy of the model i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Why is this needed ?
The model should help understand how the demand vary with features.
This should then allow the management to meet the demand levels and meet customer's expectations
This model will also help to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
