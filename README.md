## General Information
### Background:
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
### Company Info
Boom Bike wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
They want to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around.
By doing this, they want to stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
### High Level Requirements
Boom Bikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
The company wants to know the following -
Significant Variables in Predicting demand of shared bikes
How well these significant variables describe the demands of the bike
### Business Goal (Objectives)
Create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To know the accuracy of the model i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands
### Why is this needed ?
The model should help understand how the demand vary with features.
This should then allow the management to meet the demand levels and meet customer's expectations
This model will also help to understand the demand dynamics of a new market

## Conclusions
- The model can explain more than 77% of bike demand
- The top 3-4 variables contributing to the demand are
   - Temperature : Increase in temp, increases the demand of bike rentals. Year
   - 2019 was better than 2018 and hence increasing in trend bikes Rentals are more in Holidays than on working days / Non Holidays.
   - Winter Season - There is more demand during winter season
   - Sep Month - The season of Fall, has a better demand than other months.
